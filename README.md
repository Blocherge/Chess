# Chess
A not fully working text based python chess game with the beginning of graphics implementation

This is a text based chess game that I wrote in python in middle school, it currently has graphics half implemented using tkinter and the checkmate function just fully doesn't work but it will appropriately register piece movement and has pretty good exception checking for places that pieces can't be moved. I may come back to it and try to update the not working functions as well as complete the graphics portion of the engine but as any of you python folks out there know not using HTML for graphics in python kinda sucks.
